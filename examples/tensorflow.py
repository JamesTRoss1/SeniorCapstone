Originally TensorFlow was both the emotion detector and TTS 
that I had recommended for use and implementation because of
the positive feedback and ease of use that I had previously seen
throughout my research. However, when attempting to do sample 
scripts of TensorFlow, I discovered that Windows had an issue in running
current versions of TensorFlow. I attempted to run Tensorflow in a VBox
using the recommended version of Ubuntu, but also came across issues in
importing the modules into ipython as the examples showed. 
As a result of the failure of testing TensorFlow on my machine, I could 
not test TensorFlow TTS either as Tensorflow is required. We have decided 
against using TensorFlow Emotion detecting using keras as well as TensorFlow
TTS in favor of other APIs/modules due to their benefits mentioned in the
retrospective. 

Below are the guides I attempted to use to implement a test of TensorFlow:
